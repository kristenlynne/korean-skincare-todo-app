## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB/Mongoose, EJS, Passport.js

Skincare Routine was built with a team of developers to help users manage their skincare routines and ensure they never miss a step. 

- Used Figma for wire-framing and project organization.
- Built using MVC architecture for code organization and scalability.
- Used EJS to dynamically display user info.
- Implemented local authentication with Passport.js to allow each user to access their account.
- Used CSS for styling and responsiveness.

## Optimizations

- Allow users to edit items on their todo list and re-organize steps.
- Have todo list automatically reset when it's the next day so user doesn't have to do it manually using the reset button.
- Keep track of user's todo list daily to provide analytics.
- Add a section where users can add notes about their skin to see if they need to make a change in their routine.
- Recommend products the user can add to their routine.

## Lessons Learned:
